# Genalice configuration files

Genalice tools are fully configurable to obtain the best possible data results. As a consequence, each tool has a series of options to allow customized settings. Adding multiple options to the command line can be cumbersome. Therefore, option settings can be added as a configuration file through the `cmd_file` option.

Parameter configuration files start with a header section. The header is marked with the `#` character. It contains additional information associated with the configuration file. 

Each option is described as: `option_name=[value]`.

Comments can be added by using the `#` character.
