## NGS data
This study makes use of the ICR96 Exon CNV Validation series data generated by Professor Nazneen Rahmanâ€™s team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London as part of the TGMI. The ICR96 Exon CNV Validation series can be accessed through the European-Genome phenome Archive (EGA) under the accession number [EGAS00001002428](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001002428). Details of how to access the data is available at EGA or from the [ICR websire](www.icr.ac.uk/icr96).

## Reference sequences
We aligned reads and called CNVs against two assemblies of the human reference genome, including:

* GRCh37: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/GRCh37.p13_interim_annotation/

* GRCh38: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/
